Notes about files in folder "SingleVoxelScans"

TIFF stacks of light field data generated with Mathematica Notebook PolRayTraceBirefrImagingJune2023.nb using the single voxel volume data stored in folder "voxelScanVolH5Files".

superSample = 1:
voxelScanﾎ馬1m2OA100Xm7to7Y0Z0SS1RetLF.tif  is retardance image stack; original Real32 data, available in folder "voxelScanSS1LFtifFiles", were divided by 0.0541 (maximum retardance in radian) and multiplied by 255 before converting to 8-bit data

voxelScanﾎ馬1m2OA100Xm7to7Y0Z0SS1AzimLF.tif  is orientation image stack; original Real32 data, available in folder "voxelScanSS1LFtifFiles", were divided by 3.1416 (orientation in radian) and multiplied by 180 before converting to 8-bit data. The orientation is given as an angle measured from the horizontal direction of increasing pixel positions.


superSample = 3:
voxelScanﾎ馬1m2OA100Xm7to7Y0Z0SS3RetLF.tif  is retardance image stack; original Real32 data, available in folder "voxelScanSS1LFtifFiles", were divided by 0.005274 (maximum retardance in radian) and multiplied by 255 before converting to 8-bit data. All retardance LF images have 0.005274 radian as their maximum retardance.

voxelScanﾎ馬1m2OA100Xm7to7Y0Z0SS3AzimLF.tif  is orientation image stack; original Real32 data, available in folder "voxelScanSS1LFtifFiles", were divided by 3.1416 (orientation in radian) and multiplied by 180 before converting to 8-bit data. The orientation is given as an angle measured from the horizontal direction of increasing pixel positions.
